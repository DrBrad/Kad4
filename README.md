Kademlia DHT compatible with BitTorrent protocol that uses Java Reflect

Implementing Kad4 is very easy, just download the JAR and add it as a library to your project. Here are some [Example](https://github.com/DrBrad/Kad4/wiki/Examples) usages or you can take a look at our [Documentation](https://github.com/DrBrad/Kad4)
